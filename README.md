# Try React.js
Learn the fundamentals of React.js in this series. The goal of this series is to get you comfortable with React.js so you can start building more robust projects. 

We believe that React.js answers the following questions:

- How do we create our own HTML element? Something like `<cfe>Coding forever!</cfe>`
- How do we better manage dynamic state (ie `ajax` calls) with JavaScript?
- How do we make applications that feel more native (ie less page reloads)?


The goal of this series is to introduce you to React.js by creating a real project step by step. There are many layers to React.js so this series will focus on:

- Functional Components
- Hooks & Custom Hooks
- State & useState
- ContextAPI
- Routing & URL Parsing
- Basic API Calls with `fetch`
